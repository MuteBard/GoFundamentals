Go is not an object oriented programming language
There is no idea of classes inside of Go

In Go, we have the Basic Go types like string, integer, float, array and map.
We want to extend a base type and add some extra functionality to it. We need to create a new type

So, currently in our card prodram, we need to make a deck type and it will be an extension of the primitive
types that already exist

We need to create functions with receivers. we are gonna take a primitive type and extend some functionality in it.
